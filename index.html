							My mother is Joy Ann Bathan. She's 40 yrs. old. She is a housewife and the one who take care of us a lot. She's strict but she can get along with our mood. She always advice us and support our every decision in life. She's a good inspiration for us.

Me and my siblimgs our close to each other. As their eldest sister I guide them and help them to everything they need. They also help me when i need something. Sometimes we fight but that's only a playful fight. Talking and playing is a valuable thing to us because that is our bonding time.
							I don't have a perfect family. We're not rich and we already face countless challenges but our bond is still strong. I'm contented to the family that I have.

					<h1><span class="underline">Strenght and Weaknesses</span></h1>
					<p> Data encoding and multimedia arts is one of my strenght.That's because I’ve experienced to be an encoder and editor from our work immersion. Until now I’m developing my skills for being an editor. 
						As an I.T. I’m a fast learner and because I have extra experience it’s much easier for me than the other.Being an IT should have a consistent practice or work so that you will not forget the process and the instructions and it’s a total opposite of me because I’m a forgetful person.
						It takes many times of practice and many notes for me to remember every single steps. It’s definitely my weakness. In the future, I know that the path that I will choose will reveal more of my streghts and weaknesses. I will accept this strenghts and weaknesses because 
						I know that it will improve me to be a better person.
